# Dynamic-Programming-Solutions

Hey y'all. This repo contains some solutions I coded up for Dynamic Programming assignments in an Algorithms course I took Summer 2016. I tried to include one-line summaries of the problems below. There is more detailed documentation in the files themselves. 

####Solutions1.java contains the following problems:
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Longest Contiguous Subsqeuence
* Optimal Sequence of Hotel Stops
* Yuckdonald's opening restauraunts
* All Punctuation Removed: is valid sentence?
* Pebbling a checkerboard
* ABC Multiplication Operations (solution needs work)

####Solutions2.java contains the following problems:
* Is it a palindrome?
* Longest Common Substring
* Primitive String Splicing Operation
* Counting heads: probability
* Game/Sequence of cards: attain highest total
* Game/two teams: probability of winning the tournament
* Given unlimited supply of coins: make change
* Use each coin once: make change
* Given unlimited coins: make change using at most k coins
* Does some subset sum to the toal?
